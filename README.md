# 🦀 Rust Programming Knowledge Base - NotebookLM

Welcome to the **Rust Knowledge Base**, powered by **TrongHoang_Dyor**. This is a comprehensive study and reference tool for the Rust programming language, aggregated from hundreds of hours of lectures, tutorials, and in-depth presentations from RustConf, Rust Linz, and the "Crust of Rust" series.

## 📚 What's Inside?

This notebook has been ingrained with high-quality data sources, covering:

### 1. Rust Fundamentals & Core Concepts
* **Concepts:** Variables, Data Types, Functions, Control Flow.
* **Memory Safety:** The "soul" of Rust – **Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes**.
    
* **Structs & Enums:** Data organization, using `Option` and `Result` for safe error handling.
* **Traits:** Polymorphism in Rust and Generic Types.

### 2. Advanced Topics
* **Smart Pointers:** `Box`, `Rc`, `Arc`, `Cell`, `RefCell`, and Interior Mutability.
* **Concurrency:** Multi-threading with `Channels`, `Mutex`, `Send` & `Sync` traits.
* **Async/Await:** Asynchronous programming, Futures, and understanding Runtimes (like Tokio).
    
* **Macros:** Declarative Macros (`macro_rules!`) and Procedural Macros.
* **Unsafe Rust:** Working with raw pointers and FFI (Foreign Function Interface).

### 3. Real-World Applications & Ecosystem
* **Embedded Rust:** Programming for ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and Bare Metal.
    
* **WebAssembly (Wasm):** Integrating Rust with JavaScript in the browser.
* **Game Development:** Using the Bevy engine and game optimization techniques.
* **Compiler & Tooling:** Understanding `rustc`, `cargo`, `clippy`, and how the compiler works.

## 💡 How to Use NotebookLM Effectively

Once you access the link, you can use the AI to:

1.  **Q&A Concepts:** e.g., *"Explain the difference between Rc and Arc"* or *"Why am I getting a borrow checker error here?"*
2.  **Summarize Lectures:** Request a summary of the "Crust of Rust" series on Atomics.
3.  **Generate Quizzes:** Ask the AI to create multiple-choice questions to test your knowledge on Lifetimes.
4.  **Find Solutions:** Search for patterns to handle `Mutex` errors or how to structure a large Rust project.
